# 2.SOME TERMS -

CPU-central processing unit
It is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing tasks.often to referred to as the "brain" of the computer.

GPU-graphic processing unit
It is a specialized processor designed to handle and accelerate the rendering of images, video and animation.It can handle many operations simultaneously.

DPU-data processing unit

TPU-tensor processing unit

# 3.SOC(SYSTEM ON A CHIP)-
A System on Chip or an SoC is an integrated circuit that incorporates a majority of components present on a computer. As the name suggests, it is an entire system fabricated on a silicon chip. The beauty of an SoC is that it integrates all the components on a single substrate. In semiconductors, a substrate is a thin film of silicon used to fabricate integrated circuits. In contrast to the traditional motherboard, SoC integrates the replaceable components onto a single chip, thereby reducing the size and increasing efficiency.

# 4.CISC[complex instruction set computer]-
it is a closed source like intel and AMD(advanced micro devices).It develop X-86 series under ISA[intruction set arichtecture] in 1978.

# 5.RISC[reduced instruction set computer]-
it is a close source like ARM[Adavnce risc machine] .It has specific intruction,very fast and efficient.

# 6.RISC-V-
It is based on RISC principles and develop in 2023 and which is a free open source. it also have a project called SHAKTI.

# 7.ASIC:-
ASIC stands for Application-Specific integrated circuit. it's a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general puerpose use. for example, an ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining is specifically built to perform the hashing calculations required for mining.


# 8.KERNEL-
It manages operations between computer and hardware.
