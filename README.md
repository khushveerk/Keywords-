# .SOC(SYSTEM ON A CHIP)-
A System on Chip or an SoC is an integrated circuit that incorporates a majority of components present on a computer. As the name suggests, it is an entire system fabricated on a silicon chip. The beauty of an SoC is that it integrates all the components on a single substrate. In semiconductors, a substrate is a thin film of silicon used to fabricate integrated circuits. In contrast to the traditional motherboard, SoC integrates the replaceable components onto a single chip, thereby reducing the size and increasing efficiency.

 
# 2. STORAGE:-

1.primary storage: it is volatile. Primary memory provides very fast access to data,smaller capacity. e.g.RAM

2.secondary storage: it is Non-volatile
,Slower access,larger capacity: .e.g.hard disk,CD 

# 3.NETWORK:-

# 3.1 Local Area Network (LAN):
A LAN covers a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or campus. It connects devices within this limited area.

# 3.2 Wide Area Network (WAN): 
A WAN spans a large geographic area, like multiple cities, countries.  WANs can be public, like the internet, or private, like intranet.

# OPERATING SYSTEM(OS): 
An Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware

The most commonly used Operating System(OS):-

WINDOWS

MACos

LINUX

# NIC
A network interface card, also known as NIC or network interface controller, is typically a circuit board installed on the computer to connect to the network. It works as an indispensable component for the network connection of computers.

# Open Source/ Closed Source :-
Open source software refers to computer software whose source is open means the general public can access and use it. In short, it is referred to as OSS. The source code of open-source software is public. It uses the code freely available on the Internet. This code can be modified by other users and organizations means that the source code is available for anyone to look at.
Closed Sourcesoftware refers to computer software whose source code is closed means the public is not given access to the source code. In short it is referred as CSS. In closed source software the source code is protected. The only individual or organization who has created the software can only change it.

# Cloud Computing
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud"). This allows for faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

# Bare Metal System
A bare-metal system is a computer system that operates directly on the hardware without the use of an operating system. This means that the software running on the system has direct access to the hardware resources, such as the CPU, memory, and Input/Output devices.

In simpler terms, it's like running a car without a driver: the engine and other components are working directly, without any intermediary system to manage them.

# BLOCKCHAIN:
Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger technology that securely records transactions across multiple computers in a way that prevents alteration or tampering. It operates as a chain of blocks, each containing a list of transactions. Once a block is added to the chain, it is difficult to change any information in that block without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus from the network. This makes blockchain a transparent and secure method for managing and verifying transactions. It's commonly used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin but also has applications in various other fields, such as supply chain management, voting systems, and smart contracts.
Some famous examples are 
# 1.ARM

# 2.CISC[complex instruction set computer]-
it is a closed source like intel and AMD(advanced micro devices).It develop X-86 series under ISA[intruction set arichtecture] in 1978.

# 3.RISC[reduced instruction set computer]-
it is a close source like ARM[Adavnce risc machine] .It has specific intruction,very fast and efficient.

# 4.RISC-V-
It is based on RISC principles and develop in 2023 and which is a free open source. it also have a project called SHAKTI.

# 5.ASIC:-
ASIC stands for Application-Specific integrated circuit. it's a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general puerpose use. for example, an ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining is specifically built to perform the hashing calculations required for mining.

# FPGA(field programmable gate array)-
A field-programmable gate array is a type of integrated circuit that can be programmed or reprogrammed after manufacturing. It consists of an array of programmable logic block and interconnects that can be configured to perform various digital functions.This feature sets FPGAs apart from Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). The latter is explicitly made for a given goal, which one cannot change later.

# VIRTUAL MACHINE
A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that allows multiple operating systems or instances to run on a single physical machine. VMs provide isolation, encapsulation, and resource efficiency, making them valuable for development, testing, and production environments. They come in two main types: system virtual machines, which emulate entire systems, and process virtual machines, which abstract individual applications. While VMs offer numerous advantages, including flexibility and efficient resource utilization, they also come with performance overhead and management complexity.

# .Kernel
The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system. The kernel is also responsible for preventing and mitigating conflicts between different processes.

# IP ADDRESS
An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique string of numbers separated by periods or colons that identifies each device connected to a network. IP addresses serve two primary functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network. They are essential for routing internet traffic and ensuring data reaches the correct destination.

# SSL[secure socket layer]-
ip address[layer3]+ port number[layer4]

# Port number-
a way to indentify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server. eg:
HTTP-80
HTTPS-443
FTP-20,21
SMTP-25
TELMET-23
SSH[secure shell]-22

# ISP(Internet Service Provider)
An ISP, or Internet Service Provider, is a company or organization that provides individuals and businesses with access to the internet. ISPs offer various types of internet connections, including:

# DSL (Digital Subscriber Line):
Uses telephone lines to provide internet access.
# Cable: 
Uses cable television lines for internet service.
# Fiber-optic:
Uses fiber-optic cables for high-speed internet access.
# Satellite:
Provides internet access via satellite signals, useful in remote areas.
# Wireless: 
Uses radio signals to connect to the internet, which can include both fixed wireless and mobile broadband.

# DNS(Domain Name System)
DNS stands for Domain Name System. It functions like a phone book for the internet, translating human-friendly domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

# VPN(Virtual Private Network)
A VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a service that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. It allows you to access the internet as if you were connected to a private network, providing privacy and security.

![Screenshot_2024_0909_202756](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e51dbb07-2f5d-4685-b599-efdf326dcf2d)

When you use a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through a secure server before reaching its destination, adding a layer of privacy and security. However, it's important to choose a reputable VPN provider to ensure your data is handled securely and your privacy is protected.

# FRONTEND,BACKEND AND API(Application Programming Interface)

In web development, the terms frontend, backend, and API refer to different aspects of building and managing applications. Here’s a breakdown of each:

# 1.Frontend
Frontend refers to the client-side of a web application. It encompasses everything that users interact with directly in their web browsers. This includes:
# 2.Backend
Backend refers to the server-side of a web application. It involves everything that happens on the server and is responsible for managing and processing data. Key aspects include:
# 3.API
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs can be used to
connect Frontend and Backend

#Together, these components work to create a complete web application, with the frontend providing the user experience, the backend managing data and logic, and the API facilitating communication between the two.

# The 7 layers of OSI model:-

#:-Layer 7 : (Application Layer) - The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients.

#:-Layer 6 : (Presentation Layer )- The presentation layer prepares data for the application layer. It defines how two devices should encode, encrypt, and compresses data so it is received correctly on the other end.

#:-Layer 5 : (Session Layer )- The session layer creates communication channels, called sessions, between devices.

#:-Layer 4 : (Transport Layer )- The transport layer takes data transferred in the session layer and breaks it into “segments” on the transmitting end.

#:-Layer 3 : ((Networking Layer) - The network layer has two main functions. One is breaking up segments into network packets, and reassembling the packets on the receiving end.

#:-Layer 2 : (Data-Link-Layer) - The data link layer establishes and terminates a connection between two physically-connected nodes on a network.

#:-Layer 1 :( Physical Layer) - The physical layer is responsible for the physical cable or wireless connection between network nodes.

# Hypervisor :-
A hypervisor is a software layer that allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on the same physical machine. It's also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM)

![Screenshot_2024_0911_142721](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25bf2353-8753-468a-8698-06d0812da3ff)

>Types of hypervisor
# (i)Type 1

Also known as a bare-metal or native hypervisor, this type of hypervisor runs directly on the host's hardware. It's more secure and stable than Type 2 hypervisors, and is often used in enterprise data centers and server-based environments. Type 1 hypervisors can implement their own resource allocation strategies for virtual machines (VMs). Examples of Type 1 hypervisors include Microsoft Hyper-V, VMware vSphere, and KVM.

# (ii)Type 2

Also known as a hosted hypervisor, this type of hypervisor runs on top of an operating system as a software layer or application. Type 2 hypervisors are easier to install, configure, and use than Type 1 hypervisors, and are more user-friendly. However, Type 2 hypervisors are less efficient than Type 1 hypervisors because they negotiate resource allocation with the operating system. Examples of Type 2 hypervisors include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop

# proxy server-
A proxy server is a system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore, it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network. It is a server, referred to as an “intermediary” because it goes between end-users and the web pages they visit online.

# apache-
client server - uses httpd(d stands for dameon: continuously runs in background) that creates a pool of child processes or threads to handle requestes. The purpose of the daemon is to respond to network, hardware, or system requests to perform certain tasks.

Its a small segment of a large message. Data send over computer networks, such as internt, is divided into packets, recombined by client computer

# Load balancer-
It is the method of distributing network traffic eqaully across a pull of resources that support an application.

# Von Neumann architecture and harvard architecture -
The term "von Neumann architecture" has evolved to refer to any stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time

# Devops :-
DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry. Used as a set of practices and tools, DevOps integrates and automates the work of software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) as a means for improving and shortening the systems development life cycle.DevOps is complementary to agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the agile way of working

# abstruction-
Abstraction on the other side can be explained as the capability to use the same interface for different objects. Different implementations of the same interface can exist. Details are hidden by encapsulation.

# Polymorphism-
Polymorphism is a concept, which allows us to redefine the way something works, by either changing how it is done or by changing the parts used to get it done.

# Inheritance-
Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows code reusability when a class includes property of another class. Considering HumanBeing a class, that has properties like hands, legs, eyes, mouth, etc, and functions like walk, talk, eat, see, etc.

# CRYPTOGRAPHY-
Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process. IMAGE
