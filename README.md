# Keywords-
# 1.DESKTOP-->
Desktop mainly divided into three parts- 1. Computation 2.Storage 3. Network

# 2.Computation :-

CPU-central processing unit
It is the primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing tasks.often to referred to as the "brain" of the computer.

GPU-graphic processing unit
It is a specialized processor designed to handle and accelerate the rendering of images, video and animation.It can handle many operations simultaneously.

DPU-data processing unit

TPU-tensor processing unit

# 3.SOC(SYSTEM ON A CHIP)-
A System on Chip or an SoC is an integrated circuit that incorporates a majority of components present on a computer. As the name suggests, it is an entire system fabricated on a silicon chip. The beauty of an SoC is that it integrates all the components on a single substrate. In semiconductors, a substrate is a thin film of silicon used to fabricate integrated circuits. In contrast to the traditional motherboard, SoC integrates the replaceable components onto a single chip, thereby reducing the size and increasing efficiency.


# 4.CISC[complex instruction set computer]-
it is a closed source like intel and AMD(advanced micro devices).It develop X-86 series under ISA[intruction set arichtecture] in 1978.

# 5.RISC[reduced instruction set computer]-
it is a close source like ARM[Adavnce risc machine] .It has specific intruction,very fast and efficient.

# 6.RISC-V-
It is based on RISC principles and develop in 2023 and which is a free open source. it also have a project called SHAKTI.

# 7.ASIC:-
ASIC stands for Application-Specific integrated circuit. it's a type of integrated circuit designed for a specific application or function, rather than general puerpose use. for example, an ASIC designed for cryptocurrency mining is specifically built to perform the hashing calculations required for mining.

# STORAGE:-

1.primary storage: RAM
2.secondary storage:hard disk,CD 

# NETWORK:-

# Local Area Network (LAN):
A LAN covers a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or campus. It connects devices within this limited area.

# Wide Area Network (WAN): 
A WAN spans a large geographic area, like multiple cities, countries.  WANs can be public, like the internet, or private, like intranet.
# OPERATING SYSTEM(OS): 
An Operating system is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. it act as an intermediary between users and computer hardware

The most commonly used Operating System(OS):-

WINDOWS

MACos

LINUX
